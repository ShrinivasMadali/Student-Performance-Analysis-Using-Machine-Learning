# Student Performance Prediction üöÄ

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict student grades based on a variety of features, including study time, demographics, and extra-curricular activities. The primary goal is to compare the performance of different classification algorithms and identify which model provides the most accurate predictions.

## üìù Problem Statement

**Core Question:**  
*"Can we accurately predict a student's final grade using a set of demographic, social, and study-related features?"*

By answering this, we can gain insights into the key factors influencing student performance, which could be used to implement targeted interventions or support programs.

## üìä Key Questions & Answers

**1. What are the key predictors of student grades?**  
- Features like `weeklystudytime` and `Absent` days show strong relationships with final grades.  
- `weeklystudytime` ‚Üí positive correlation (more study time ‚Üí higher grades)  
- `Absent` ‚Üí negative correlation (more absences ‚Üí lower grades)  

**2. Which machine learning model performs best?**  
- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (~91%).  
- Its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships gave it an edge over other models.  

**3. How accurate are the model predictions?**  
| Model                     | Accuracy Score |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Random Forest Classifier   | ~91.0%        |
| Support Vector Machine     | ~82.3%        |
| Logistic Regression        | ~63.0%        |

The Random Forest model correctly predicts student grades more than 9 out of 10 times.
