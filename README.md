Student Performance Prediction
üöÄ Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict student grades based on a variety of features, including study time, demographics, and other extra-curricular activities. The primary goal is to compare the performance of different classification algorithms and identify which model provides the most accurate predictions.

üìù Problem Statement
The core problem addressed in this notebook is:

"Can we accurately predict a student's final grade using a set of demographic, social, and study-related features?"

By answering this, we can gain insights into the key factors influencing student performance, which could be used to implement targeted interventions or support programs.

üìä Key Questions & Answers
This project resolves several key questions through data analysis and model training:

What are the key predictors of student grades?
Answer: Based on the correlation matrix, features such as weeklystudytime and the number of Absent days show a notable relationship with the final Grade. weeklystudytime has a positive correlation, meaning more study time is generally associated with a higher grade. Absent days has a negative correlation, indicating that more absences are linked to lower grades.

Which machine learning model performs best for this classification task?
Answer: The Random Forest Classifier is the best-performing model. It achieved the highest accuracy of ~91.0% in predicting student grades. This model's ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in the data gave it a significant advantage over the other models.

How accurate are the model predictions?
Answer: The accuracy scores for each model are:

Random Forest Classifier: ~91.0%

Support Vector Machine (SVM): ~82.3%

Logistic Regression: ~63.0%
The Random Forest model is highly accurate, correctly predicting the student's grade more than 9 out of 10 times.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library used for feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization and plotting the results, such as correlation matrices and ROC curves.

Confusion Matrix (Random Forest)
This confusion matrix for the best-performing model shows how many predictions were correct versus incorrect for each grade category.
!

ROC Curve
The ROC curve visually represents the performance of the classification models at all classification thresholds. The higher the curve and the larger the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the better the model's performance.

üí° Project Insights and Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we can draw the following key conclusions:

Model Selection: The Random Forest Classifier is the most effective model for this prediction task, significantly outperforming both the SVM and Logistic Regression models. Its high accuracy suggests that this ensemble method is well-suited for handling the complexity of the features in the dataset.

Influential Features: The correlation matrix and other visualizations reveal which features have the strongest relationships with student grades. For instance, weeklystudytime and Absent are likely to be among the most influential factors.

Real-World Application: The high-performing model could be used by educators to identify students who may be at risk of falling behind. By analyzing a student's data early in the year, a school could use the model's predictions to proactively offer support, such as tutoring or mentorship, to improve their chances of success.

This project provides a clear and repeatable process for analyzing student performance data and applying machine learning to derive meaningful and actionable insights.
